#  Mortality Monitoring 

+ Mortality is an ‘outcome’ measure
+ ‘Smoke alarms’ related to quality of care (Keogh,2013)
+ Confused with being a quality metric
	+ Not clearly linked with poor care (Lilford et al, 2004)
	+ Low signal-to-noise ratio (Lilford & Pronovost, 2010) 
	+ Poor proxy of avoidable deaths (Girling et al, 2017)
+ Susceptible to various biases (Mohammed et al ,2012)

---
#  Standardisation 

+ Crude rates useful in a stable system
+ “Case-mix” differs between hospitals and over time
+ Two common ways to adjust for this:
	+ **Direct Standardisation** (adjust all to common standard and compare)
	+ **Indirect Standardisation** (adjust all to compare to average expected rate)

---
#  Common Methods 

+ Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR) (Jarman et al, 1999)
	+ Conditions accounting for ~80% in-hospital deaths
	+ Extensive case-mix adjustment
+ Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Index (SHMI) (Campbell et al, 2012)
	+ All deaths in hospital or within 30 days of discharge
	+ All admissions (excl. still birth)
	+ Fewer case-mix factors than HSMR
+ Both create stratified logistic regression models, per diagnostic group.
+ Models used to predict probability of death per-patient

---
#  Standardised Ratio 

+ 10 identical patients:
	+ Risk factor of model
	+ E.g. age, sex, primary diagnosis etc.
+ If these patients had a probability of death of 0.3 (30%)
	+ Expected deaths = 10 * 0.3 = 3
+ If we then observed 4 deaths:
+ >1 = “higher than expected”
+ <1 = “lower than expected”

---
#  Visualising Uncertainty in SMRs 

+ Confidence intervals
+ Process control theory:
	+ Control limits
	+ “Special-cause” variation
+ Funnel plots (Speigelhalter, 2005a)
	+ Plot measure of size (expected) on x-axis
	+ SMR on the y-axis

#  Issues with Funnel Plots 

+ Are we asking the right question?
+ Implicit ranking
+ Which limits do we use?
+ Overdispersion
	+ Assumed to be clustering
	+ Adjustment proposed (Spiegelhalter, 2005b)
	+ Alternative used by NHSD  (plotted right)
+ Strictly cross-sectional

#  Monitoring Mortality over time 



---
#  Monitoring Mortality over time 

+ Relative Risk snapshot not helpful
	+ Denominator is not fixed
+ Control chart approach attractive
	+ Sensitive to variation over time
+ Various other chart types suited to different questions:
	+ P-charts, C-Chart, G-Chart etc.
+ The challenge is the risk-adjusted element

---
#  CUSUM 

+ Risk-adjusted, log-likelihood ratio, cumulative summary chart with triggers and resets.
+ Accepted as ‘best’ option (Bottle & Aylin, 2011) , given:
	+ Ability to work with risk-adjusted data
	+ Earliest alerting chart in comparison studies
+ Two main applications:
	+ Z-score-based aggregated CUSUM (Spieglehalter et al, 2012)
	+ Patient level CUSUM (Steiner et al 2000)

---
#  What are we plotting? 

+ Where C = is the cusum value, starting from 0,
+ the cusum value at observation/time-point t,
+ the cusum weight (log-likelihood ratio) for observation/time-point t.

---
#  Z-score method 

+ Assume overdispersion, so model hierarchically
+ We assume local trust mean ( ), with standard deviation ( ).
+ Local means distributed around zero, with standard deviation ( )
+ CUSUM is a hypothesis test:
	+  <U+2192>	Local mean within tolerance( ), usually 0.5
	+ <U+2192>	Local mean (plus tolerance) + difference deemed 				‘out of control’, usually 2.
+ Transform to z-scores:
+ *Detecting doubling of log-likelihood ratio, with 0.5 tolerance*

---
#  Person-level method 

+ Based on method by (Steiner et al, 2000)
+ Calculate a weight for each patient:
+ Plot consecutive patients, based on discharge date

---
#  Triggers and Resets 

+ Threshold set for “trigger” to investigate
	+ Normal approximation for z-score cusum (Grigg & Spiegelhalter, 2008)
	+ Approximation within site/group (Bottle & Aylin, 2011)
+ After trigger we reset at avoid continual triggers
	+ Usually to zero
	+ Imperial college method is to half, based on (Lucas and Crosier, 1982)

---
#  How are they used? 

+ Interactive modules and online tools
+ Monthly email alerts
+ CUSUMs built for diagnostic groups with both methods
+ Use published approximation for person-level triggers
