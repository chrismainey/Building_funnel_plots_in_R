#  Overview 

+ What's a funnel plot?
+ What's overdispersion?
+ What do we do about it?

--

<br><br>
+ _If you are interested:_
  + How to set up and build an R package
  + What I've learned from the process
  + How to publish it to CRAN

##  Context:
### Monitoring Standardised Mortality

+ How do we compare between organisations with different patients?

--

+ Indirectly Standardised Ratios:
 + Predict an expected rate for each unit
 + Case-mix adjustment

$$ SR=\frac{\Sigma{(\text{observed deaths})}}{\Sigma{(\text{predicted deaths})}} $$
--

+ <b>Predicted = Expected,  but $\ne$ 'preventable'</b>


---
#  Standardised Ratio example

+ 10 identical patients:
 + Risk factor of model
 + E.g. age, sex, primary diagnosis etc.

--

+ If these patients had a probability of death of 0.3 (30%)
 + Expected deaths = 10 * 0.3 = 3

--

+ If we then observed 4 deaths:
 + $>1$ = higher than expected
 + $<1$ = lower than expected

# Question:
### How can we present these data appropriately?


---
#  Visualising Uncertainty in SMRs 

+ Confidence intervals
+ Statistical process control charts
+ Funnel plots (Speigelhalter, 2005a)

## Funnel Limits and Overdispersion

+ Plot above is based on Poisson disribution, used for counts

--

+ Poisson distribution has fixed variance, mean and variance = $\mu$:

$$Pr(Y=y) = \frac{\mu^ye^{-\mu}}{y!}$$
__where:__: \mu$ is the expected average count or rate, 
+ $e$ is Eulerâ€™s number (the base of the natural logarithm: ~2.71828), 
+ and $y!$ is the factorial of y.


--

### "Real-world" data isn't perfectly Poisson distributed!
+ Causes us to underestimate the error in the data
+ Often caused by under-specification, poor parameterisation, clustering, aggregation
 
---

# Clustering of organisations

.pull-left[
+ Regression assume independence
+ We've got repeated measurements form the same organsiation.
+ Both _within_ trust variation $\sigma$
<br>
+ And _between_ trust variation $\tau$
+ Can model with a __random-intercept__


Traditional regression model has single-intercept

# z-scores (1)

+ Compare different indicators on standard scale
+ Scale indicators by their standard deviation: $\frac{Y - Target}{\sigma^2}$

--

+ This is only valid for normally distributed data
+ Proportions, counts & standardised ratios not normally distributed

--

<br>
### Transformations:
+ __CQC/Spiegelhalter:__ square-root + Winsorization
+ __SHMI:__ natural logarithm + truncation

--

### Dispersion ratio is calculated on winsorised/truncated scores:

$$ \phi = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2}{n}$$
---
# z-scores (2)

The dispersion ratio ( $\phi$ ):
+ <=1, the set $\tau^2 = 0$
+ Otherwise:

--

$$\tau^2 = \frac{(n \phi-(n-1))}{\sum_{i=1}^n W_i - (\sum_{i=1}^n W_i^2 / \sum_{i=1}^n W_i)}$$
_Where:_ 
 + $W_i$ is $1/\sigma^2$, the within Trust ( $i$ ) standard deviation
 + $\phi$ is the dispersion ratio

___These techniques are imprecise estimates of random intercepts in models___

# Funnel Plots

- Control limits commonly 95 and 99% (`r knitr::asis_output("\u2248")` 2 and 3 `r knitr::asis_output("\u03c3")` )
- OD issue:
 - Limits are independent of data, and relate to sample size (predicted)
 - Limits are too tight.
--

- We can inflate them using the $\tau^2$ calculated above.

- Control limits are then, functionally: $1 \pm z * (\frac{\sigma + \tau}{n})$
- Taken >= 99.8% limits

## Seeing the plot again:

funnel_plot(numerator=SHMIdt$OBSERVED, denominator=SHMIdt$EXPECTED, group = SHMIdt$PROVIDER_NAME, 
          title = "Funnel plot of NHSDigital's SHMI data Oct18-Spet19", 
          Poisson_limits = TRUE,  OD_adjust = FALSE,label_outliers = TRUE, return_elements = "plot")

## Seeing the plot again:
__OD adjustment__

```{r plot3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#  Issues with Funnel Plots 

+ Are we asking the right question?
+ Implicit ranking
+ Which limits do we use?
+ Overdispersion
	+ Assumed to be clustering
	+ Adjustment proposed (Spiegelhalter, 2005b)
	+ Alternative used by NHSD  (plotted right)
+ Strictly cross-sectional
