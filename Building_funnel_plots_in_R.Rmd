#  Mortality measurement 



---
#  Mortality Monitoring 

+ Mortality is an ?outcome? measure
+ ?Smoke alarms? related to quality of care (Keogh,2013)
+ Confused with being a quality metric
	+ Not clearly linked with poor care (Lilford et al, 2004)
	+ Low signal-to-noise ratio (Lilford & Pronovost, 2010) 
	+ Poor proxy of avoidable deaths (Girling et al, 2017)
+ Susceptible to various biases (Mohammed et al ,2012)

---
#  Standardisation 

+ Crude rates useful in a stable system
+ ?Case-mix? differs between hospitals and over time
+ Two common ways to adjust for this:
	+ **Direct Standardisation** (adjust all to common standard and compare)
	+ **Indirect Standardisation** (adjust all to compare to average expected rate)

---
#  Common Methods 

+ Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR) (Jarman et al, 1999)
	+ Conditions accounting for ~80% in-hospital deaths
	+ Extensive case-mix adjustment
+ Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Index (SHMI) (Campbell et al, 2012)
	+ All deaths in hospital or within 30 days of discharge
	+ All admissions (excl. still birth)
	+ Fewer case-mix factors than HSMR
+ Both create stratified logistic regression models, per diagnostic group.
+ Models used to predict probability of death per-patient

---
#  Standardised Ratio 

+ 10 identical patients:
	+ Risk factor of model
	+ E.g. age, sex, primary diagnosis etc.
+ If these patients had a probability of death of 0.3 (30%)
	+ Expected deaths = 10 * 0.3 = 3
+ If we then observed 4 deaths:
+ >1 = ?higher than expected?
+ <1 = ?lower than expected?

---
#  Visualising Uncertainty in SMRs 

+ Confidence intervals
+ Process control theory:
	+ Control limits
	+ ?Special-cause? variation
+ Funnel plots (Speigelhalter, 2005a)
	+ Plot measure of size (expected) on x-axis
	+ SMR on the y-axis

---
#  Issues with Funnel Plots 

+ Are we asking the right question?
+ Implicit ranking
+ Which limits do we use?
+ Overdispersion
	+ Assumed to be clustering
	+ Adjustment proposed (Spiegelhalter, 2005b)
	+ Alternative used by NHSD  (plotted right)
+ Strictly cross-sectional
